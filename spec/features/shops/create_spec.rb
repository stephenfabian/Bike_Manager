# As a visitor

# When I fill in the form with the child's attributes:
# And I click the button "Create Child"
# Then a `POST` request is sent to '/parents/:parent_id/child_table_name',
# a new child object/row is created for that parent,
# and I am redirected to the Parent Childs Index page where I can see the new child listed

# When I visit a Parent Childs Index page
# Then I see a link to add a new adoptable child for that parent "Create Child"
# When I click the link
# I am taken to '/parents/:parent_id/child_table_name/new' where I see a form to add a new adoptable child
